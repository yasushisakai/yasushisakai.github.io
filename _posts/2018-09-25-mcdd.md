## Virginia San Fratello
- different material
> diff: Neri Oxman + reusable material ?

## Marc Fornes - "Mass Customization"
- extensive curveture
- explict and encoded
- precise -> reproducable
- triangulation -> quadulation -> n edges
- agent based mathematical solving -> process digitilization
  - hard to debug/decode
  - shce
- mass customization -> all ways exponential, math determination
- **sound structure**
- **measuring success using social media**

## Panel
- different group
- V and M, demonstrate what we can do.
