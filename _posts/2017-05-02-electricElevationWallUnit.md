# Electric Wall Units

## detailed specifications

- no info on actuators or parts, max cap 20kg, stroke 650mm

I would imagine, like a company large as Panasonic has its own motor manufacture line.
Digikey has 133,216 products including 1091 AC/DC motors from Panasonic. 
(+ Asia in general, it's easier than the U.S. to get a better motor/actuator)

- around 2200usd (ordinary wall unit 300usd)
	- usually cheaper when the dealers / local carpenters actually purchase it
	- japan has very 'sticky' negotiation between manufacture and dealer, esp housing
	- which is another reason why its hard to expand globally

## It's domestically sold as a 'system kitchen' categorized under the overhead compartments  
Lixil(which acquired 'American Standard'), TOTO, Panasonic are the three big names,
but do not seem to expose it to the global market. Kitchens are domestic products I guess.

## Most major kitchen and sanitary equipment companies have (had) them

stopped selling them

## General trend is stop production & 'Galapagos' product
Dilemma on cost and space = people who are affordable has larger kitchens, or multiple houses/kitchens. One review says there is no need if you have a standard kitchen table depth.
