## how to make ATMega328 programmable from Arduino IDE

assumes you have avrdude, below command changes the fuse. Second line is for verification.

```
cd ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino/hardware/avr/1.6.12/bootloaders/optiboot
avrdude -b 19200 -c usbtiny -p m328p -v -e -U efuse:w:0x05:m -U hfuse:w:0xDE:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m
avrdude -b19200 -c usbtiny -p m328p -v -e -U flash:w:optiboot_atmega328.hex -U lock:w:0x0F:m
```
