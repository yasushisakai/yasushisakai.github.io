# haskell introduction memo

- no global states

- procedure vs declaring
    - do vs is
    - order is important in DO
    - order does not matter 
    ```haskell
    a = 1 * b * c
    b = 2 * c
    c = 2
    ```
    - works, but you can't re-assignment
 - no { mutable, for/while, if without  else}
 - reduce freedom => less complexity
 ```haskell
 foo :: Int -> Int
 foo x = 2 * x

 factorial :: Int -> Int
 factorial 0 = 1
 factorial n = n * factorial (n -1)

 addInt :: Int -> Int -> Int
 addInt x y = x + y
 ```

```
> 4 'function' 6
> function 4 6 
:t(+)
```

currying
```
addTree :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
is the same as
addThree :: Int -> Int -> (Int -> Int)
second line means gets two ints and returns a function that needs one Int that returns a Into
```
```
let numbers = [1,2,3,4]
numbers !! 2 
> 3
head, tail, init, last
drop, take
```
 you need a let in interpreter

 ```
 sumFloat :: [Float] -> Float
 sumFloat [] = 0
 sumFloat (x:sx) = x + sumFloat xs
 x:sx is get head:tail

 _ means anything else

gaurd function
where


f = 2 * x
g = x + 1
(f . g) 2

class is close to interfaces in Java

type constructors / data constructors

map, filter, fold(reduce)

learn you a haskell for great good
whiy function programming matters
can programming be liberated from the von Neumann Style

Scala is more important
